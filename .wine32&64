For Win32 applications, we create a directory ~/.wine32 to store the configurations.

1.  "WINEARCH=win32 WINEPREFIX=~/.wine32 winecfg"

For Win64 applications, we create a directory ~/.wine64 to store the configurations.

"WINEARCH=win64 WINEPREFIX=~/.wine64 winecfg"

 For Win32 applications, we specify the Win64 configuration directory as WINEPREFIX before wine.

 "WINEPREFIX=~/.wine64 wine app.exe"
 
 Run Display Scaling
For some old applications, the display usually is very small. We could scale the display using a scaling script.

For example, to scale the display of app.exe by 1.5x, we could run the following command.

 "WINEPREFIX=~/.wine32 run_scaled --scale=1.5 wine app.exe"

Example
We will use running Windows WeChat as an example.

Download WeChat
 "wget https://dldir1.qq.com/weixin/Windows/WeChatSetup.exe"
