Configure Wine

 "WINEARCH=win64 WINEPREFIX=~/.wine64 winecfg"

Make sure virtual desktop is used in winecfg. In my case, I used resolution 2560 x 1440 for the virtual desktop.


Install WeChat

$ cd /mnt
$ WINEPREFIX=~/.wine64 wine WeChatSetup.exe

WeChat will be installed in ~/.wine64/drive_c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/Tencent/WeChat/WeChat.exe by default.

Run WeChat

 "WINEPREFIX=~/.wine64 wine ~/.wine64/drive_c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/Tencent/WeChat/WeChat.exe"
 
 I tried fcitx input from the host computer to the WeChat in the container and it worked fine.
